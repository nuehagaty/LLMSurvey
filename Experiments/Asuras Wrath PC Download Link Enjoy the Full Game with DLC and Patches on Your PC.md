## Tips for Playing Asura's Wrath on PC
 
Here are some tips for playing Asura's Wrath on PC using RPCS3:

- The game is fully playable on PC with good performance[^1^] [^2^], but you may encounter some minor graphical glitches or audio issues. To fix them, you can try changing the renderer, resolution scale, or audio backend in the settings.
- The game runs at 30 fps by default, but you can unlock it to 60 fps by applying a patch that you can find online. However, this may cause some animations or cutscenes to speed up or slow down. To avoid this, you can toggle between 30 fps and 60 fps by pressing F1 while playing.
- The game supports both keyboard and mouse input and controller input. You can configure your input device by clicking on Configuration > Pads. You can also use third-party software like DS4Windows or XInputMapper to emulate a PS4 or Xbox controller.
- The game has DLC episodes that add more content and story to the main game. You can download them from the PlayStation Store or from other sources online. To install them on RPCS3, you need to copy or move them to dev\_hdd0\game\NPUB30721\USRDIR\content\episode folder inside your RPCS3 directory.
