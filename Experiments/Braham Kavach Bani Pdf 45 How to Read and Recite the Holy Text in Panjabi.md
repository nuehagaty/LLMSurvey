Braham Kavach is a composition attributed to Guru Hargobind Sahib, the sixth Sikh Guru. It is a prayer for protection from all kinds of dangers and enemies. The word "Braham" means the supreme God, and "Kavach" means armor or shield. Braham Kavach is also known as Dasam Bani, as it is part of the Dasam Granth, a collection of writings by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru.
 
Braham Kavach consists of 32 verses, each describing a different aspect of God's protection. The prayer invokes the names and attributes of various Hindu deities, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Ganesh, etc., as well as Sikh Gurus and martyrs. The prayer also mentions various weapons and armors that God bestows upon the devotee to fight against evil forces. The prayer is believed to provide physical, mental and spiritual security to the reciter.
