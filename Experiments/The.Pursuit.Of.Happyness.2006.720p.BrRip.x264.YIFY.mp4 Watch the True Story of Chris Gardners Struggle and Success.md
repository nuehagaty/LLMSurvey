The film follows Gardner's journey from being evicted from his apartment, sleeping in shelters and subway stations, to landing an internship at Dean Witter Reynolds, a prestigious brokerage firm. Along the way, he faces many challenges and obstacles, such as losing his only source of income, his bone-density scanners, being arrested for unpaid parking tickets, and competing with 19 other interns for the only job offer. He also tries to maintain a loving relationship with his son, Christopher Jr., played by Smith's real-life son Jaden Smith, who makes his film debut.

The film's title is derived from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attends.
