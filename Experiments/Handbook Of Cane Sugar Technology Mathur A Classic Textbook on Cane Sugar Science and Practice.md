The earliest evidence of sugar cane cultivation dates back to around 8000 BCE in New Guinea, where the indigenous people chewed raw sugar cane for its sweet taste. Sugar cane cultivation then spread to Southeast Asia, China, India, and Persia via seaborne traders. The Indian people were the first to develop a method of extracting juice from sugar cane and crystallizing it into sugar granules around 350 BCE. They also kept the process of sugar making a closely guarded secret, resulting in rich profits through trade across the subcontinent.
  
Sugar cane was introduced to the Mediterranean region by the Arabs in the 7th century CE, who brought it to Egypt, North Africa, Spain, and Sicily. The Arabs also improved the sugar making process by using lime to clarify the juice and by inventing new types of furnaces and molds. Sugar became a highly valued commodity in Europe, especially among the nobility and clergy. Sugar was used as a spice, a medicine, a preservative, and a sweetener for various foods and drinks.
  
The expansion of sugar cane cultivation to the Americas was driven by the growing demand for sugar in Europe and the availability of land and labor in the New World. The Portuguese were the first to establish sugar plantations in Brazil in the early 16th century, followed by the Spanish in the Caribbean and Mexico. The French, Dutch, and British also joined the sugar trade by colonizing islands such as Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, and Cuba. Sugar plantations relied heavily on slave labor from Africa to perform the arduous tasks of planting, harvesting, and processing sugar cane. The transatlantic slave trade was closely linked to the sugar trade, as millions of Africans were forcibly transported to work on sugar plantations.
  
The development of sugar cane technology continued in the 18th and 19th centuries with several innovations that increased efficiency and productivity. For example, in 1747, a German chemist named Andreas Marggraf discovered that sugar could be extracted from beets as well as from cane. This led to the emergence of beet sugar industry in Europe, which reduced dependence on imported cane sugar. In 1813, two French engineers named Norbert Rillieux and David Chaix invented a multiple-effect evaporator that used steam to heat and concentrate sugar juice. This device reduced fuel consumption and improved sugar quality. In 1846, an American dentist named William Morton demonstrated the use of ether as an anesthetic for surgery. He used a device called an inhaler that was originally designed by Rillieux for sugar refining.
  
Sugar cane technology has also faced challenges and changes in the 20th and 21st centuries due to social movements, environmental issues, market fluctuations, and technological advancements. For instance, the abolition of slavery in the 19th century led to labor shortages and social unrest on many sugar plantations. The rise of nationalism and independence movements in the 20th century resulted in political upheavals and revolutions in many sugar producing countries. The emergence of alternative sweeteners such as high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners reduced the demand for cane sugar in some markets. The growing awareness of climate change and biodiversity loss prompted efforts to adopt more sustainable practices for sugar cane cultivation and processing.
